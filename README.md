# Export Media URLs
extract media URLs of your wordpress website

## Description

This plugin allows you to extract all URLs of your media, along with title, date, and type. It supports writing output in CSV file, or you can view URLs within the dashboard. It can be very useful during migration, seo analysis, and security audit. You can **export Mediaâ€™s**:

- IDs
- Titles
- URLs
- Date Uploaded
- And its Type

The data can be filtered by Author, before extraction.

## When we need this plugin?
- To check Media URLs of your website
- During migration
- During security audit
- To remove demo images, imported by theme

Youâ€™ll be surprised to know that, there exist some media, which you never know off or maybe it is imported by theme demo. But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll be able to find those URLs with the help of this small utility and perform the cleanup. ðŸ™‚

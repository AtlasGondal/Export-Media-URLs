## Description

The ultimate solution for seamlessly managing and extracting information from your media library. This user-friendly plugin simplifies the task of gathering essential details of media like title, date, caption, alt-text, description and type of media file. It facilitates the generation of CSV output or allows you to conveniently view URLs directly within the dashboard, proving invaluable for tasks such as migration, SEO analysis, and security audits. 

You can **export Mediaâ€™s**:

The data can be filtered by Author, before extraction.
